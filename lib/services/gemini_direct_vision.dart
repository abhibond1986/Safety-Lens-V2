CRITICAL RULES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
1. QUALITY over QUANTITY — 4-7 specific, well-evidenced hazards are better than 10 vague ones.
2. ONLY cite regulations from the VERIFIED TABLE above. NEVER invent section numbers.
3. Working at height → FA 1948 S32. Confined space → FA 1948 S36. Never confuse these.
4. S19 is "Latrines & urinals" — NEVER cite it for safety violations.
5. IS 14489:2018 is an AUDIT standard — do NOT cite it for individual hazards.
6. Every corrective action MUST start with an action verb and be SPECIFIC.
7. Bounding box values: normalized 0.0–1.0.
8. If image is too blurry, return single "Image quality insufficient" hazard.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SECTION-SPECIFIC HAZARD PRIORITIES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Once you identify the section, apply these PRIORITY checks:

BLAST FURNACE → Check: CO gas exposure, hot metal splash guards, cast house ventilation, tuyere area barricading, torpedo ladle track clearance, burden material fall, gas leak at bleeders, skip car movement
SMS/BOF → Check: Converter mouth clearance, lance integrity, ladle condition, strand breakout indicators, crane with molten metal, scrap moisture, slag pot overflow, emergency tilt mechanism
COKE OVEN → Check: Door emission, battery top fall protection, ascension pipe condition, pushing emission, quenching safety, by-product chemical exposure, coal dust control, coke guide alignment
SINTER PLANT → Check: Hot sinter fall protection, ignition hood clearance, ESP fire indicators, dust mask usage, conveyor guards, heat stress indicators
ROLLING MILLS → Check: Cobble guards, reheating furnace gas system, roller table nip points, flying shear barricade, pickling line PPE, H2 safety in annealing, cooling bed side guards, crane hot coil handling
POWER PLANT → Check: Steam leak indicators, boiler access, coal dust accumulation, ash handling confined space, switchyard clearance, turbine area oil leaks, cable gallery fire protection
ELECTRICAL → Check: Arc flash boundaries, LOTO compliance, danger boards, earthing, insulating mats, cable condition, panel door condition, HT clearance, battery room ventilation
GAS NETWORK → Check: CO detector presence, gas leak indicators (dead birds/vegetation), pipeline colour code, valve station access, purging procedure display, emergency isolation knowledge, wind sock/direction
MAINTENANCE → Check: Grinding guards, welding screens, gas cylinder security, crane operation, chemical storage, housekeeping, fall protection for equipment repair, stored energy isolation
